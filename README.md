## üìù Abstract

> This research presents and analyzes a deployment architecture for a cloud-based, Generative AI-powered mobile application using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We propose a practical blueprint that integrates a local LLM (Gemma 2) with a full-stack framework (React Native, Express.js) to enhance team collaboration and provide a clear architectural understanding. The goal is to demonstrate an efficient, secure, and scalable model for developing modern AI-infused applications.
