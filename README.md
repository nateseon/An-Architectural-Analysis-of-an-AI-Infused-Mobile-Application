# An Architectural Analysis of a Cloud-based AI-Infused Full-Stack Mobile App Powered by RAG


## Abstract
This research presents and analyzes a deployment architecture for a cloud-based, Generative AI-powered mobile application using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We propose a practical blueprint that integrates a local LLM (Gemma 2) with a full-stack framework (React Native, Express.js) to enhance team collaboration and provide a clear architectural understanding. The goal is to demonstrate an efficient, secure, and scalable model for developing modern AI-infused applications.




## System Architecture
The core of this research is a visual representation of the app's deployment architecture using a UML diagram. The diagram illustrates the interaction between seven key nodes, including the mobile frontend, backend API, database, vector store, and the LLM.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React Native

Backend: Express.js

Database: MongoDB Atlas

LLM: Gemma 2 (via Ollama)

Vector DB: ChromaDB

MLOps: MLflow

Model Server: FastAPI
